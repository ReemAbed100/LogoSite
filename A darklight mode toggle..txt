A dark/light mode toggle.
Search or filter with real-time results.
🔁 1. Make the Gallery Interactive
Right now you’re using a table — that’s a good base. Let’s upgrade it:

Add a filter or dropdown menu to select a brand (e.g., Apple, Google, Nike) and dynamically update the table/logos shown.

Turn each logo into a clickable card that opens a modal or side panel showing more info (year, context, design changes, maybe even a fun fact).

Add hover effects on logos (e.g., scale up, show the year, fade-in caption).

🕹 2. Timeline View (Highly Recommended!)
Let users scroll through time with a horizontal or vertical timeline:

Add a timeline slider where they can scrub through years and see how the logo changes.

Maybe even animate it — the logo fades or morphs into the next one as you scroll or slide.

🎬 3. Intro Animation
When the site loads:

Animate the current logo morphing into its older versions rapidly.

Or a splash screen showing the evolution of a famous brand quickly before entering.

📱 4. Responsiveness & Mobile Friendliness
Make sure your gallery adjusts nicely on smaller screens — maybe switch from table view to card or vertical scroll view on phones.

📖 5. Storytelling per Logo
Create a dedicated page per brand or per logo year with:

Backstory of the redesign.

Who designed it, what changed, why.

Include cool trivia or quotes from the company during that era.

🧠 6. Search & Sort
Let users:

Search for a brand.

Sort by most changed / least changed.

Or even compare two logos side by side (e.g., 1987 vs 2020).

✏️ 7. Personal Touch
Add a footer or "About This Project" section:

Talk briefly about why you chose this idea.

Maybe include your favorite logo redesign and why.

Professors love seeing your thought process and passion.
